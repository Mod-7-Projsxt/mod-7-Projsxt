## üöÄ Mission statement

Our application,  is for people who want to see the country flags. It allows users to see the country names, flags, population, overall information for each country

## API & React Router

This application will use the REST Countries API. Below are the documentation and specific endpoints we intend to use and the front-end pages that will use them.

- Link to API documentation: https://restcountries.com/

- [API endpoint #1](https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all)
(https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all)
  - All of the information
  - List of data values used by the endpoint
  ___
- [API endpoint #2](https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all?fields=name,capital,continents,currencies)

(https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all?fields=name,capital,continents,currencies)
  - This will fetch the `name`, `capital`,`continents`,`currencies`
  - `name`, `capital`,`continents`,`currencies`
  ___
- [API endpoint #3](https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all?fields=flags)
(https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all?fields=flags)
  - This will fetch the `flags` object that includes the  `png`,`svg`,`alt`
  - I will be using the `svg`

[If your API requires an API key, say so here.]
